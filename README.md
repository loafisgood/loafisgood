Hello! ðŸ‘‹



I'm Lucas and a Grade 11 student in Toronto. 
I enjoy creating things and projects such as websites, games, and more. 
I mainly focus on web development but I also have interest in machine learning and game development. 

Please feel free to contact or reach out to me via linkedin or email! ðŸ˜Š
